About Vamp</a></h2>
<a class="el" href="namespaceVamp.html" title="If you want to compile using FFTW instead of the built-in FFT implementation for...">Vamp</a> is an API for C and C++ plugins that process sampled audio data to produce descriptive output (measurements or semantic observations). Find more information at <a href="http://www.vamp-plugins.org/">http://www.vamp-plugins.org/</a> .<p>
Although the official API for <a class="el" href="namespaceVamp.html" title="If you want to compile using FFTW instead of the built-in FFT implementation for...">Vamp</a> plugins is defined in C for maximum binary compatibility, we strongly recommend using the provided C++ classes in the SDK to implement your own plugins and hosts.<h2><a class="anchor" name="plugins">
For Plugins</a></h2>
Plugins should subclass <a class="el" href="classVamp_1_1Plugin.html" title="Vamp::Plugin is a base class for plugin instance classes that provide feature extraction...">Vamp::Plugin</a>, and then use a <a class="el" href="classVamp_1_1PluginAdapter.html" title="PluginAdapter turns a PluginAdapterBase into a specific wrapper for a particular...">Vamp::PluginAdapter</a> to expose the correct C API for the plugin. Read the documentation for <a class="el" href="classVamp_1_1PluginBase.html" title="A base class for plugins with optional configurable parameters, programs, etc.">Vamp::PluginBase</a> and <a class="el" href="classVamp_1_1Plugin.html" title="Vamp::Plugin is a base class for plugin instance classes that provide feature extraction...">Vamp::Plugin</a> before starting.<p>
Plugins should be compiled and linked into dynamic libraries using the usual convention for your platform, and should link (preferably statically) with -lvamp-sdk. Any number of plugins can reside in a single dynamic library. See <a class="el" href="plugins_8cpp.html">plugins.cpp</a> in the example plugins directory for the sort of code that will need to accompany your plugin class or classes, to make it possible for a host to look up your plugins properly.<p>
The following example plugins are provided:<p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="classZeroCrossing.html" title="Example plugin that calculates the positions and density of zero-crossing points...">ZeroCrossing</a> calculates the positions and density of zero-crossing points in an audio waveform.</li></ul>

<li><a class="el" href="classSpectralCentroid.html" title="Example plugin that calculates the centre of gravity of the frequency domain representation...">SpectralCentroid</a> calculates the centre of gravity of the frequency domain representation of each block of audio.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="classAmplitudeFollower.html" title="Example plugin implementing the SuperCollider amplitude follower function.">AmplitudeFollower</a> is an implementation of SuperCollider's amplitude-follower algorithm as a simple <a class="el" href="namespaceVamp.html" title="If you want to compile using FFTW instead of the built-in FFT implementation for...">Vamp</a> plugin.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="classPercussionOnsetDetector.html" title="Example plugin that detects percussive events.">PercussionOnsetDetector</a> estimates the locations of percussive onsets using a simple method described in "Drum Source Separation using Percussive Feature Detection and Spectral Modulation" by Dan Barry, Derry Fitzgerald, Eugene Coyle and Bob Lawlor, ISSC 2005.</li></ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" name="hosts">
For Hosts</a></h2>
Hosts will normally use a <a class="el" href="classVamp_1_1PluginHostAdapter.html" title="PluginHostAdapter is a wrapper class that a Vamp host can use to make the C-language...">Vamp::PluginHostAdapter</a> to convert each plugin's exposed C API back into a useful <a class="el" href="classVamp_1_1Plugin.html" title="Vamp::Plugin is a base class for plugin instance classes that provide feature extraction...">Vamp::Plugin</a> C++ object.<p>
Starting with version 1.1 of the <a class="el" href="namespaceVamp.html" title="If you want to compile using FFTW instead of the built-in FFT implementation for...">Vamp</a> SDK, there are several classes in the <a class="el" href="namespaceVamp_1_1HostExt.html">Vamp::HostExt</a> namespace that aim to make the host's life as easy as possible:<p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="classVamp_1_1HostExt_1_1PluginLoader.html" title="Vamp::HostExt::PluginLoader is a convenience class for discovering and loading Vamp...">Vamp::HostExt::PluginLoader</a> provides a very simple interface for a host to discover, load, and find out category information about the available plugins. Most "casual" <a class="el" href="namespaceVamp.html" title="If you want to compile using FFTW instead of the built-in FFT implementation for...">Vamp</a> hosts will probably want to use this class.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="classVamp_1_1HostExt_1_1PluginInputDomainAdapter.html" title="PluginInputDomainAdapter is a Vamp plugin adapter that converts time-domain input...">Vamp::HostExt::PluginInputDomainAdapter</a> provides a simple means for hosts to handle plugins that expect frequency-domain input, without having to convert the input themselves.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="classVamp_1_1HostExt_1_1PluginChannelAdapter.html" title="PluginChannelAdapter is a Vamp plugin adapter that implements a policy for management...">Vamp::HostExt::PluginChannelAdapter</a> provides a simple means for hosts to use plugins that do not necessarily support the same number of audio channels as they have available, without having to apply a channel management / mixdown policy themselves.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a class="el" href="classVamp_1_1HostExt_1_1PluginBufferingAdapter.html" title="PluginBufferingAdapter is a Vamp plugin adapter that allows plugins to be used by...">Vamp::HostExt::PluginBufferingAdapter</a> (new in version 1.2) provides a means for hosts to avoid having to negotiate the input step and block size, instead permitting the host to use any block size they desire (and a step size equal to it). This is particularly useful for "streaming" hosts that cannot seek backwards in the input audio stream and so would otherwise need to implement an additional buffer to support step sizes smaller than the block size.</li></ul>
<p>
The PluginLoader class can also use the input domain and channel adapters automatically to make the entire conversion process transparent to the host if required.<p>
Hosts should link with -lvamp-hostsdk.<p>
(The following notes in this section are mostly relevant for developers that are not using the HostExt classes, or that wish to know more about the policy they implement.)<p>
The <a class="el" href="namespaceVamp.html" title="If you want to compile using FFTW instead of the built-in FFT implementation for...">Vamp</a> API does not officially specify how to load plugin libraries or where to find them. However, the SDK does include a function (<a class="el" href="classVamp_1_1PluginHostAdapter.html#08d7ed3a11bf4a3c30fa0f9b41a0fed6">Vamp::PluginHostAdapter::getPluginPath()</a>) that returns a recommended directory search path that hosts may use for plugin libraries.<p>
Our suggestion for a host is to search each directory in this path for .DLL (on Windows), .so (on Linux, Solaris, BSD etc) or .dylib (on OS/X) files, then to load each one and perform a dynamic name lookup on the vampGetPluginDescriptor function to enumerate the plugins in the library. The example host has some code that may help, but this operation will necessarily be system-dependent.<p>
<a class="el" href="namespaceVamp.html" title="If you want to compile using FFTW instead of the built-in FFT implementation for...">Vamp</a> also has an informal convention for sorting plugins into functional categories. In addition to the library file itself, a plugin library may install a category file with the same name as the library but .cat extension. The existence and format of this file are not specified by the <a class="el" href="namespaceVamp.html" title="If you want to compile using FFTW instead of the built-in FFT implementation for...">Vamp</a> API, but by convention the file may contain lines of the format<p>
<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">vamp:pluginlibrary:pluginname::General Category &gt; Specific Category
</pre></div><p>
which a host may read and use to assign plugins a location within a category tree for display to the user. The expectation is that advanced users may also choose to set up their own preferred category trees, which is why this information is not queried as part of the <a class="el" href="namespaceVamp.html" title="If you want to compile using FFTW instead of the built-in FFT implementation for...">Vamp</a> API itself.<p>
There is an example host in the "host" directory from which code may be drawn.<h2><a class="anchor" name="license">
